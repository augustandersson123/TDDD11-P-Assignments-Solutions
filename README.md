# TDDD11-P-Assignments-Solutions
Solutions to some P-Assignments from the course TDDD11, Foundational Programming. 

P-Assignments are distinct from O-assignments in this course. 
O-assignments make up the regular lab series, a total of 5 hp (credits), which is graded with Pass or Fail. 
P-assignments are given every week and come in three levels. These levels correspond to the grades 3, 4 and 5. 
In order to unlock a P-assignment at a higher level, the student must pass the P-assignment at the proceeding level. 

Types and corresponding grade upon succesful completion: 
P2.0, P2 -  3 
P3.0, P3 -  4
P5, P8   - 5

Note that new P-assignments are generated every week. Thus, all solutions in this repository are solutions to old problems. 

Use at your own risk.
